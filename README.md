# Uwajibikaji - Crowdsourced Infrastructure Monitoring App
Uwajibikaji is a mobile application that empowers citizens to report and track infrastructure issues, such as damaged roads, broken bridges, and faulty utilities, in Kenya. By leveraging crowdsourced data, the app aims to bridge the communication gap between local authorities and the public, ensuring that infrastructure issues are resolved efficiently and transparently.

Category Selection: Users can select the type of issue they are reporting, from options like "Roads," "Bridges," "Water Supply," etc.
